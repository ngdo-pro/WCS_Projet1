# Ratatouille

This is my very first programming project. Made with php, it was only a showcase, nothing really work behind :)

##Â How to play with it:

### Requirements:
You need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
### Run it with:
- `docker-compose up`
- Site should be available on [http://localhost](http://localhost)
